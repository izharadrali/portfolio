/*
Recommendations for production:
- Use a callable Cloud Function as a trusted endpoint to write messages,
  or require users to complete an authentication/recaptcha step before
  allowing writes directly to Firestore.
- Limit the fields and size of incoming messages in rules.
- Monitor and rate-limit writes via server-side logic.
